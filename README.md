**📊 Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**
**🔍 Project Overview**

This project focuses on Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using a real-world dataset. The main goal is to develop strong data analysis skills by handling raw, inconsistent data and transforming it into meaningful insights.

The dataset used in this project is based on Netflix content data, containing information about movies and TV shows.

**🎯 Objectives**

Handle missing and inconsistent data

Detect and treat outliers

Perform feature engineering

Conduct correlation and distribution analysis

Generate meaningful insights from the dataset

Present findings in a structured EDA format

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical visualizations

**🧹 Data Cleaning Steps**

✔ Handling missing values
✔ Removing duplicate records
✔ Standardizing inconsistent data formats
✔ Converting columns to correct data types

**📈 Exploratory Data Analysis**

Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows

Year-wise content trends

Country-wise content production

Rating distribution

Duration analysis

Genre/category analysis

Correlation between features

**🧠 Key Insights**

Netflix content has grown significantly after 2015

Movies dominate the platform compared to TV Shows

Certain countries produce the majority of Netflix content

Ratings and duration patterns reveal audience preferences

**🚀 How to Run the Project**

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Run the Python file:
python netflix_eda.py

**📌 Future Improvements**
Add interactive dashboards (Plotly / Power BI)

Deploy EDA as a web app

Apply machine learning for content prediction
